        <p>Ted is a male born in Maryland and raised in the Chicago land area. After receiving his B.S. in chemistry in 2012, Ted has decided to venture into the world of programming. He is pretty excited to make stuff and subsequently give it away to others for $free.99. Ted also likes exercising, playing video games, pizza, and <a href="https://youtu.be/B-yUKS3O66A">this very specific video of a seal screaming.</a></p>
